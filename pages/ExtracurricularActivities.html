                        I have assisted year-long coaching programs in robotics, and communication techniques for 20+ mentees aged 12 to 19 years old, yearly.
                        After following these coaching programs, the mentees developed a strategy of thinking through problems, started using modern technology 
                        tools positively,and increased their chances of accessing STEM higher education opportunities.
